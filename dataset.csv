1,"In the last fifteen years dramatic changes have occurred in early childhood education, particularly in early literacy. Responding to the research, public libraries have transformed their services to young children and caregivers. In 2004, the Public Library Association launched Every Child Ready to Read. Maryland librarians were on the forefront of this effort, which developed in tandem with their It's Never Too Early campaign. At the same time, libraries have been trying to develop outcome measures to assess their impact on users. The current study uses data from a kindergarten readiness assessment in literacy and finds a positive correlation with children's library use as shown by circulation and attendance at children's programs in Maryland. This paper examines the implications of such research on policies and practices and makes recommendations for future study."
2,"Freedom of expression as a right has been protected by many nations' Constitutions and human right organizations. Freedom of expression has a long history in both the Western and Islamic worlds. Each viewed, defined, and analyzed the term differently based on their values and principles. Unsurprisingly, the Western and Islamic worlds do not completely agree on the meaning of freedom of expression. Though, they do share an agreement on certain aspects of freedom of expression. In particular, freedom of expression is to speak, write, act, and believe freely without causing harm to the society or any individual. The disagreement is on the limitations of freedom of expression. Further, it is central to mention that the existence of the Internet has impacted how people perceive freedom of expression in both worlds.

On the other hand, as a basic human right, freedom of expression has been examined, analyzed, and compared substantially by legal experts. More importantly, several studies within the legal arena have compared the notion of freedom of expression among countries' legislations. Therefore, freedom of expression has been studied solidly through the legal lens. However, social science scholars started to study freedom of expression when the Internet appeared. There are not any comparative studies in any social science field that examine freedom of expression among countries. More significantly, no studies relating between individuals' cultural background and/or religious beliefs and how these individuals shape their perception of freedom of expression exist. For that reason, I plan to examine how culture and religion may impact how older and younger generations perceive the notion of freedom of expression in the digital-technology era. My study will compare South Africa as a Western-based values country and Kuwait as Islamic country. To better understand the influence of culture and religion on people's perception of freedom of expression, I intend to describe the culture and the religion of both countries. Additionally, my research will compare legislations concerning freedom of expression and its limitations in each country and examine the views and perceptions of people.

In order to examine the complexity of the topic of freedom of expression, I will conduct an international and comparative study through the mixed-methods research approach. Drawing from social science and information studies perspectives, I hope this study will lead to understanding of culture and religion's influence on people's conceptualization of the notion of freedom of expression in digital-technology era and hopefully reach valuable results that help legal experts better understand freedom of expression and its limitations."
3,"This dissertation explores the peculiar history of the bookmobile in the United States from the close of the nineteenth century to the turn of the twenty-first. In the process, it insists that a spatial politics of shared information was key to constructing and contesting community in twentieth-century America. Grounded in cultural geography, American Studies, and book history, it is an interdisciplinary investigation of the roles that bookmobiles played in efforts to build what some reformers called “common consciousness,” a sense of cultural and spiritual connection. Indeed, the bookmobile emerged not just as a tool for getting books into far-flung hands but also as a way to confront two persistent questions: What should our communities look like in this new century, and who should be included in them? This dissertation argues that the bookmobile’s answers to those questions both shaped and were shaped by three factors—racial segregation, imperial expansion, and consumer capitalism—that ultimately exposed the limits of the dream of a common consciousness.

Drawing on research in archival and published sources, this dissertation looks at a series of moments when bookmobiles, by moving purportedly public culture through supposedly shared space, forced Americans to consider what it would mean to hold ideas and objects in common. A set of five thematically distinct and roughly chronological chapters allows the dissertation to touch down in particular times in particular places—in Progressive-Era Kansas, in the Jim Crow South, in New Deal New Mexico and Cold War West Germany, in suburban supermarkets, and in Silicon Valley—while offering an expansive view of the relationship between community, space, and culture in America."
4,"All students, including those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer (LGBTQ), need quality library books which reflect their experiences. This mixed-method research project examines whether public high school library professionals are self-censoring their library collections when it comes to materials with LGBTQ themes. Quantitative data were collected from 120 Ohio public high school libraries, while 12 school librarians were interviewed. The study found that school libraries tended to have significantly fewer LGBTQ-themed books than titles with other kinds of controversial content, but that certain factors, including schools with large number of students; schools with a racially diverse student body; schools located in liberal-leaning communities; and schools that employ certified librarians, are present in schools with more inclusive LGBTQ collections. Qualitative findings supported the quantitative analyses and stressed the importance of a supportive community and administration when developing a quality, inclusive library collection."
5,"This paper examines the presence of death in contemporary, 1990-2013, award-winning picture books in the United States, Canada, England, and Australia. Literary awards nationally, and globally, recognize titles that are considered to be exemplary in their genre. These awards—the Caldecott from the United States, the Governor General's Award for English-Language Illustration, the Kate Greenaway Medal from the United Kingdom, and the Children's Book Council of Australia's Best Picture Book of the Year Award—are the most prestigious in their country of origin and greatly impact the economic value and visibility of each title, the global children's book market, and the careers of the winning author and illustrators. Although death education for young children is hotly debated, its importance cannot be understated. Given the continuing trend of research showing the benefits of death education for children there has been a remarkable lack of award-winning literature that depicts death, dying, and learning how to cope with the extreme feelings these events create. A larger presence of death in award-winning children's literature would provide an easy-to-find, and reference, guide of excellent books parents or other adults could give to children to teach them about death, healthy coping methods, and empathy."
6,"We are experiencing an antimicrobial resistance (AMR) crisis, brought on by the drying up of the antibiotic discovery pipeline and the resulting unchecked spread of resistant pathogens. Traditional methods of screening environmental isolates or compound libraries have not produced a new drug in over 30 years. Antibiotic discovery is uniquely difficult due to a highly restrictive penetration barrier and other mechanisms that allow bacteria to survive in the presence of toxic compounds. In this Perspective, we analyze the challenges facing discovery and discuss an emerging new platform for antibiotic discovery. The penetration barrier makes screening conventional synthetic compound libraries largely impractical, and actinomycetes, the main source of natural product compounds, have been overmined. The emerging platform is based on understanding the rules that guide the permeation of molecules into bacteria and on advances in microbiology, which enable us to identify and access attractive groups of secondary metabolite producers. Establishing this platform will enable reliable production of lead compounds to combat AMR."
7,"Background: Adiponectin has been implicated to play a role in the pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Many studies have assessed serum adiponectin concentrations in COPD patients. However, results from different reports were not consistent. To assess the association of serum adiponectin concentrations and COPD, a meta-analysis was performed. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library were searched for eligible studies. Data were extracted, and then standard mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Conclusions: This meta-analysis indicates that patients with COPD have higher serum adiponectin concentration than healthy controls."
8," There is currently no definitive treatment for the painful scar. Autologous adipose tissue grafting (AATG) as a treatment option for scars has become increasingly popular and there is now an abundance of evidence in the literature that supports its application. Some studies suggest that human adipose tissue is a rich source of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells. To our knowledge, there is currently no systematic literature review to date that examines the effectiveness of AATG for reducing pain in scars. Our novel systematic review aims to examine clinical studies on the use of AATG in the treatment of the painful scar. Methods: A literature search was performed using the following databases: PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, Medline, Cochrane library and Embase. The following key words and search terms were used: adipose stem cells, scar, pain, autologous fat grafting, scar management and neuropathic pain. Human interventional studies using autologous adipose tissue grafting for the treatment of painful scars including case series, case-control, cohort studies and randomized controlled trials were reviewed. Results: A total of 387 studies were found and 18 studies from January 1990 to January 2019 were identified as relevant for the purpose of this systematic review. Two studies were evidence level V, seven were evidence level IV, six were evidence level III, two were evidence level II and one was level I. A total of 337 scars were assessed in 288 patients for improvement in pain after scar treatment using adipose tissue grafting. An improvement in the analgesic effect was recorded in 12 of the 18 studies with adipose tissue grafting. A total of 233 of the 288 treated subjects responded with reduction in pain, whereas the rest did not. We carried out a pooled analysis of the studies and observed an odds ratio of 3.94 (P = 0.00001) when comparing pain reduction to no change in pain. Conclusions: We conclude that AATG is a promising and safe modality for the treatment of the painful scar. There is an abundance of low-level evidence to support its use as an alternative treatment but there is a lack of high-level evidence at present to support its standard use. Future long-term randomized controlled trials with analgesic scores as the primary outcome measures are required to assess long-term efficacy."
9,"Background: Candida is a fungus that causes various types of candidemia, which is the fourth major infectious disease of the blood system. MALDI-TOF-MS is a simple and rapid detection instrument. The aim of the present study was to verify the accuracy of MALDI-TOF-MS in detecting Candida. Method: A pooled analysis of articles on MALDI-TOF-MS for diagnosis of candidemia was performed. The quality of original research was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) guidelines. Stata 12.0 software was used to merge the correct identification rates of Candida and Candida subspecies and obtain pooled sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic methods. Heterogeneity was found in the subgroup analysis of the included articles. Hence, we explored the factors causing the heterogeneity and its impact on the overall situation. Sensitivity analysis was used to examine the effect of Candida level on total response. Egger's test was used to evaluate the publication bias of the included articles."
10,"Deep learning has had a profound impact on computer science in recent years, with applications to image recognition, language processing, bioinformatics, and more. Recently, Cohen et al. provided theoretical evidence for the superiority of deep learning over shallow learning. We formalized their mathematical proof using Isabelle/HOL. The Isabelle development simplifies and generalizes the original proof, while working around the limitations of the HOL type system. To support the formalization, we developed reusable libraries of formalized mathematics, including results about the matrix rank, the Borel measure, and multivariate polynomials as well as a library for tensor analysis."
11,"Business cards have been widely used to greet business professionals and exchange contact information. However, the current paper-based way to manage business cards impedes their effective usage, leading to a need for digitalising and extracting business card information. This paper aims to design a business card reader (BCR) application for Android devices. Based on Google vision library, the application digitalises and extracts business card information. We evaluate the application on a dataset of 170 business cards. The results show that the application can digitalise business cards and extract contact information with 88.4% of accuracy. We then further conduct a comparative analysis of our application and other commercial BCR applications. Based on the results, the paper suggests several recommendations for future research."
12,"Our main contribution is the application of visual programing language (VPL) and mobile devices (MDs) to the control systems learning, which improved students. understanding in a quasi-experimental design with regular students. The teaching environment for process control systems that use VPL and MDs was the key to solve the learning difficulties that students had despite considering constructive alignment between instruction, learning and assessment, authentic activities, and design-based learning approach. Graphic elements used by VPL, taken from a library made of reusable blocks, with different shapes and colors make it easier to understand process control systems. Also, VPL showed the entire process control system at a glance through the different MDs used, which were laptops, tablets, and smartphones. All of these MDs are well known and user-friendly to students. Comparative evaluation of the students. learning performance, with and without the use of VPL and MD, showed the effectiveness of the redesign. Process control systems learning were facilitated, reducing the difficulties of traditional teaching, and improving the students' understanding. Also, students. self-efficacy was positively impacted."
13,"Purpose This paper aims to present a systematic review of design for six sigma (DFSS) methods applicable to the product development process (PDP) of durables goods and identify a research opportunity on the subject proposing integration of DFSS and a reference model for the PDP. In this way, through the analysis of the theoretical references identified in the scientific databases, it was possible to propose a conceptual model for the PDP oriented to the DFSS. Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on the theoretical framework presented in peer-reviewed scientific research papers during the period 2000 to 2018 on the theme DFSS applied in the PDP, as well as such as the product development tools/techniques and statistics addressed. By means of key words defined by the acronyms of DFSS methods (DMADOV, ICOV, DMEDI, IDOV, DDOV, PIDOV, DMADIC, DCCDI, DMADV, IDDOV, CDOV and DCOV), DFSS and the acronym DFSS. Applying Boolean expression during the conduction of the searches through the scientific evidence at the Brazilian scientific database platform (Capes database). This database platform is maintained by coordination for the improvement of higher education personnel, which including Emerald Insight (Emerald), Scopus (Elsevier), Science Direct, SpringerLink, Taylor Francis, Scielo (Web of Science), Wiley Online Library, Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), etc. It was obtained, by means of the searches, 269 papers related to subject DFSS, of which 18 papers had been critically selected for the composition of a conceptual model for the process of development of product guided to the DFSS. Findings This study presents a review of the literature (systematic review and content analysis) on DFSS and its effectiveness for the PDP. The DFSS methodology is disseminated in the scientific literature through a variety of methods that are often mistaken for the six sigma methodology - DMAIC, which is directed toward process improvement. The PDP integrated with the DFSS concepts contributes to eliminating possible failures during the design of a new product, directing to reduce costs and improve the quality of the product and process. Originality/value Through the systematic review and content analysis, it was possible to observe that the DFSS methods applied to product development are not related to the PDP reference models available in the literature. In this way, the fusion of the concepts of the DFSS methods and PDP reference models for the construction and proposition of a preliminary conceptual model DFSS oriented to the process of product development intends to contribute in the development of new products with the reduction of time, reduction of the cost, competitive price and consumer satisfaction."
14,"Purpose Improving hospital patient flow has become a policy priority, to effectively balance the increasing demands of an unknown and variable volume of patients with limited available hospital resources. A systematic literature review was conducted in order to identify actions, actors involved and enablers in improving hospital patient flow. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach Searches were conducted in Scopus, Web of Science, MEDLINE and The Cochrane Library for quantitative and qualitative empirical primary studies with patients (adults) receiving inpatient acute hospital care. The study protocol was based on PRISMA-P guidance. A critical appraisal of included studies was performed by using the Quality Improvement Minimum Quality Criteria Set. Findings In total, 38 key papers were identified. A wide range of actions are reported, but most studies focus on one or a few departments instead of a whole hospital. Process efficiency is most often used as a performance indicator, clinical outcomes are poorly analyzed, and patients' expectations and experience are rarely considered. Top-management commitment and front-line staff involvement are considered key factors for the success of implementations. Patient involvement in the process improvement is rarely mentioned. Originality/value Achieving improvements in hospital patient flow requires the design and implementation of complex, multifaceted and coordinated interventions. This study may be of value to healthcare managers, helping them to act effectively in their context, and to researchers of future studies including the different variables and the patient's perspective."
15,The application of combinatorial chemistry to heterogeneous catalysis is analysed in terms of current strategies and perspectives on the industrial and academic levels. Potential methodologies for academic research laboratories are proposed with emphasis on both theoretical and practical considerations. 
16,"This paper presents the implementation of the recent methodology called Adaptable Time Warping (ATW) for the automatic identification of mixture of crystallographic phases from powder X-ray diffraction data, inside the framework of a new integrative platform named hIT(e)Q. The methodology is encapsulated into a so-called workflow, and we explore the benefits of such an environment for streamlining discovery in R&D. Beside the fact that ATW successfully identifies and classifies crystalline phases from powder XRD for the very complicated case of zeolite ITQ-33 for which has been employed a high throughput synthesis process, we stress on the numerous difficulties encountered by academic laboratories and companies when facing the integration of new software or techniques. It is shown how an integrative approach provides a real asset in terms of cost, efficiency, and speed due to a unique environment that supports well-defined and reusable processes, improves knowledge management, and handles properly multi-disciplinary teamwork, and disparate data structures and protocols."
17,"The application of combinatorial methods to three reactions catalyzed by multimetal oxides is described. Catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene were tested using a 121- or 144-channel scanning mass spectrometer primary screening reactor and a 48-channel fixed bed secondary screening reactor; catalysts for the selective oxidation of ethane to acetic acid were tested using a 256-channel massively parallel microfluidic reactor primary screen alone, and catalysts for the selective ammoxidation of propane to acrylonitrile were tested using the massively parallel microfluidic reactor and an eight-channel fixed bed secondary/tertiary screening reactor. The details regarding catalyst design, synthesis, and screening are presented. This work has resulted in both the confirmation of published results and the generation of new lead materials for all three chemistries."
18,"Based on a small number of early experimental results, it can be anticipated that high throughput experimentation (HTE) will play a significant role in the discovery of new zeolites and related materials. The four prime stages in the HTE approach are introduced, in the specific context of work on zeolite synthesis. Key experimental and computational issues are detailed and illustrated by recent literature results. Bottlenecks to achieving the throughput estimated as necessary for a planned level of productivity in new materials discovery are discussed. "
19,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with clinical, biological, and pathological features occurring along a continuum from normal to end-stage disease. Currently, the diagnosis of AD depends on clinical assessments and post-mortem neuropathology, which is unbenefited early diagnosis and progressive monitoring. In recent years, clinical studies have reported that the level of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood neurogranin (Ng) are closely related to the occurrence and subsequent progression of AD. Therefore, the study used meta-analysis to identify the CSF and blood Ng levels for the development of diagnosis biomarker of patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We searched the Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases. A total of 24 articles eligible for inclusion and exclusion criteria were assessed, including 4661 individuals, consisting of 1518 AD patients, 1501 MCI patients, and 1642 healthy control subjects. The level of CSF Ng significantly increased in patients with AD and MCI compared with healthy control subjects (SMD: 0.84 [95% CI: 0.70-0.98], P < 0.001; SMD: 0.53 [95% CI: 0.40-0.66], P = 0.008), and higher in AD patients than in MCI patients (SMD: 0.18 [95% CI: 0.07-0.30], P = 0.002), and CSF Ng level of patients with MCI-AD who progressed from MCI to AD was significantly higher than that of patients with stable MCI (sMCI) (SMD: 0.71 [95% CI: 0.25-1.16], P = 0.002). Moreover, the concentration of Ng in blood plasma exosomes of patients with AD and MCI was lower than that of healthy control subjects (SMD: -6.657 [95% CI: -10.558 to -2.755], P = 0.001; and SMD: -3.64 [95% CI: -6.50 to -0.78], P = 0.013), and which in patients with AD and MCI-AD were also lower than those in patients with sMCI (P < 0.001). Furthermore, regression analysis showed a negative relationship between MMSE scores and CSF Ng levels in MCI patients (slope = -0.249 [95% CI: -0.003 to -0.495], P = 0.047). Therefore, the Ng levels increased in CSF, but decreased in blood plasma exosomes of patients with AD and MCI-AD, and highly associated with cognitive declines. These findings provide the clinical evidence that CSF and blood exosomes Ng can be used as a cognitive biomarker for AD and MCI-AD, and further studies are needed to define the specific range of Ng values for diagnosis at the different stages of AD."
